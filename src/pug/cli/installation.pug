    h1 Framework7 CLI Installation

    p First of all make sure you have latest stable Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.
    p If you are going to target Native/Hybrid apps then you also need to install <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a> first (may require `sudo`):
    ```shell
      npm install -g cordova
    ```

    p Now we can install Framework7 CLI (may require `sudo`):
    ```shell
      npm install -g framework7-cli
    ```

    p If you have issues with installation related to access errors, you may try to run the command with additional flags:
    ```shell
      npm install -g framework7-cli --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
    ```

    p If you don't want to install it globally, it can also be used with <a href="https://github.com/npm/npx" target="_blank">npx</a>.



    p Problem: icons are missing on macOS
    p Solution:

    p Add --flat for cpy within postinstall command section in file package.json
    ```shell
      "postinstall": "cpy --flat ./node_modules/framework7-icons/fonts/*.* ./src/fonts/ && cpy --flat ./node_modules/material-icons/iconfont/*.* ./src/fonts/"
    ```
    p then run:
    ```shell
      npm run postinstall
    ```
    p And you are good to go.
