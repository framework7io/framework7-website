    h1 Create App with Framework7 CLI

    h2 Create App

    p To create Framework7 app, run the following command in the directory where you want to create the app:

    ```shell
      framework7 create
    ```

    p Program will prompt for few questions about framework and template you want to start with.

    h2 Skip Update

    p On `create` command CLI will first check for CLI update to always deliver latest and better experience. If, for some reason, you want to disable it, you can run command with `--skipUpdate` flag:

    ```shell
      framework7 create --skipUpdate
    ```

    h2 User Interface

    p Framework7 CLI allows to launch create app process with user interface. This way is the most recommended as it provides a much higher configuration of the created project.

    p To launch it with UI, run the `create` command with `--ui` flag in the directory where you want to create the app:

    ```shell
      framework7 create --ui
    ```

    p It will launch UI where you will be able to configure the project:

    p
      img(src="/i/docs/cli-ui.png").docs-image

    p By default it launches server on `localhost:3001` address. If you want to change the port then use `--port <n>` argument:

    ```shell
      framework7 create --ui --port 8080
    ```

    h2 NPX

    p If you didn't install Framework7 CLI globally, you can create the app using <a href="https://github.com/npm/npx" target="_blank">npx</a> command.

    p For example:

    ```shell
      npx framework7-cli create --ui
    ```
