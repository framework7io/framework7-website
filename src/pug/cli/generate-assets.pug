    p Based on created project configration, `assets-src` can contain the following files:

    ul
      li `cordova-splash-screen.png` - cordova app splash screen image. Appears if your project targets iOS or Android mobile app
      li `cordova-ios-icon.png` - cordova iOS app icon. Appears if your project targets iOS mobile app
      li `cordova-android-icon.png` - cordova Android app icon. Appears if your project targets Android mobile app

      li `apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS web icon. Appears if your project targets "web app" or "PWA"

    h2 Generate Assets

    p To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

    ```shell
      framework7 assets
    ```

    p This command will generate all required sizes of icons and splash screens and place them automatically where they need to be.

    h2 Skip Update

    p On `assets` command CLI will first check for CLI update to always deliver latest and better experience. If, for some reason, you want to disable it, you can run command with `--skipUpdate` flag:

    ```shell
      framework7 assets --skipUpdate
    ```

    h2 User Interface

    p Framework7 CLI allows to launch assets generation process with the user interface.

    p To launch it with UI, run the `assets` command with `--ui` flag in the directory with your app.

    ```shell
      framework7 assets --ui
    ```

    p It will launch UI where you will be able to replace assets with custom ones and generate the required icons.

    p
      img(src="/i/docs/cli-assets-ui.png").docs-image

    p By default it launches server on `localhost:3001` address. If you want to change the port then use `--port <n>` argument:

    ```shell
      framework7 assets --ui --port 8080
    ```

    h2 NPX

    p If you didn't install Framework7 CLI globally, you can generate assets using <a href="https://github.com/npm/npx" target="_blank">npx</a> command.

    p For example:

    ```shell
      npx framework7-cli assets --ui
    ```
