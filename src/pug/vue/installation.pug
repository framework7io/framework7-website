    h1 Installation
    p It is really easy to build your app with Framework7 and Vue. To get started we need to install Framework7, Vue, Framework7-Vue plugin. You can skip this step and use one of the ready to use <a href="/templates/">starter app templates</a>.
    h4 1. Install Framework7
    p First of all we need to <a href="../docs/installation.html">install Framework7</a> library itself.
    h4 2. Install Vue
    p Read about how to install Vue on the official <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html" target="_blank">Vue Installation Guide</a>.
    h4 3. Install Framework7-Vue Plugin
    p Now we need the Framework7-Vue plugin for Vue, we can do it with two ways:
    ul
      li
        p
          b Download From GitHub Repository
        p We can download required Framework7 files from <a href="https://github.com/framework7io/framework7-vue/releases">Framework7-Vue GitHub repository</a>.
      li
        p
          b Install From NPM
        p We can also install Framework7-Vue from NPM:
        pre
          code
            :code
              $ npm install framework7-vue
    p From the downloaded package we will need files from <code>dist/</code> folder

    h2 ES Module
    .important-note
      p This feature currently can be used in bundlers like Webpack and Rollup
    p Framework7-Vue can also be imported as an ES-next module:
    pre
      code.js
        :code
          import Framework7Vue from 'framework7-vue'
    .important-note
      p <b>By default it exports only core Framework7-Vue plugin without any components</b>.
    p And if you need additional components they must be imported additionally:
    pre
      code.html
        :code
          <!-- some-component.vue -->
          <template>
            ...
          </template>
          <script>
            // Import F7 components you need
            import { f7List, f7ListItem, f7Navbar } from 'framework7-vue';

            export default {
              // register F7 Vue components in required Vue component
              components: {
                f7List,
                f7ListItem,
                f7Navbar,
              }
            }
          </script>
    h2 ES Module Bundle
    p If you need to include all Framework7-Vue components, we can include its another script bundle with all Vue components registered:
    pre
      code.js
        :code
          // Import framework with all components
          import Framework7Vue from 'framework7-vue/dist/framework7-vue.esm.bundle.js';

    h2 App HTML Layout
    p Now when we have downloaded/installed Framework7-Vue, we can start from creating <a href="app-layout.html">App Layout</a>.
