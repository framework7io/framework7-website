    h1 Active State
    p Framework7 uses so called "active state" to highlight links and buttons when you tap them. It is done to make Framework7 app behave like native app, not like a web app.
    p It works almost in the same way as CSS <code>:active</code> selector, it adds <code>active-state</code> class to links and buttons when you tap them. The only difference is that it adds this class after small time interval, this prevents false highlights during page scrolling.
    p So when you write your CSS styles you should write active states like:
    :code(lang="css")
      /* Usual state */
      .my-button {
          color: red;
      }
      /* Active/tapped state */
      .my-button.active-state {
          color: blue;
      }
    p You can control which elements will receive <code>active-state</code> class in <code>touch.activeStateElements</code> #[a(href="app.html#app-parameters") app parameters].
    p There are some situations when you may have nested active-state elements. You may prevent setting active state on parent element by adding <code>prevent-active-state-propagation</code> class to child active-state element:

    :code(lang="html")
      <div class="card card-expandable">
        <div class="card-content">
          <!-- Tap on button will prevent setting active-state on parent card -->
          <a class="button prevent-active-state-propagation">...</a>
        </div>
      </div>
