    h1 Migration from Framework7 v8 to v9

    p In this article we will walk through most of the breaking changes to check what needs to be done to migrate your app from Framework7 v8 to Framework7 v9.
    p You can also check the <a href="/release-notes/">full changelog here</a>

    h2 iOS Theme Updates
    p Framework7 v9 brings all new iOS 26 styles across all components:
    ul
      li Updated visual design to match the latest iOS design language
      li Refined spacing, typography, and visual elements
      li Improved consistency across all iOS theme components

    h2 Material Theme Updates
    p The Material theme has been significantly updated with the latest Material You specifications:
    ul
      li Color schemes updated to latest Material You spec
      li New <strong>Vibrant</strong> color scheme - provides more colorful and dynamic appearance
      li New <strong>Monochrome</strong> color scheme - provides neutral, grayscale appearance
      li Updated look for Range slider with better visual feedback
      li Updated look for Progressbar with refined animations
      li Reworked page transitions with improved effects and direction handling

    h2 Navbar
    h3 Removed Dynamic Navbar
    p The <code>dynamicNavbar</code> functionality has been removed. This feature allowed automatic navbar transitions between pages.
    ul
      li Remove <code>dynamicNavbar</code> parameter from your app configuration
      li Navbar transitions will now work automatically based on the standard page transition logic
      li No additional configuration is needed - navbars will transition naturally with pages

    h3 Back Link Text
    p The default back link text has been changed:
    ul
      li Previously: Back links showed "Back" text by default
      li Now: Back links use <strong>icon only</strong> by default (no text)
      li This provides a cleaner, more modern interface
      li If you need back link text, you'll need to explicitly add it in your markup:
    :code(lang="html")
          <div class="navbar">
              <div class="navbar-bg"></div>
              <div class="navbar-inner">
                  <div class="left">
                      <a href="#" class="link back">
                          <i class="icon icon-back"></i>
                          <span>Back</span>
                      </a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="title">Page Title</div>
              </div>
          </div>

    h2 Photo Browser
    p Photo Browser has been simplified by removing theme mode options:
    ul
      li Removed both light and dark mode specific settings
      li Photo Browser now uses the same light or dark mode as your app
      li It automatically adapts to your app's current theme
      li Remove any <code>theme</code> parameter from Photo Browser configuration
      li Remove any light/dark specific styling overrides

    h2 Autocomplete
    p Autocomplete component has been updated for a cleaner interface:
    ul
      li Removed default "Cancel" text
      li Now uses <strong>icon only</strong> for the cancel button
      li Provides more consistent interface across all components
      li If you need custom cancel text, you'll need to explicitly add it using the <code>closeButtonText</code> parameter

    h2 Smart Select
    p Smart Select component has been updated similarly:
    ul
      li Removed default "Cancel" text
      li Now uses <strong>icon only</strong> for the cancel button
      li Provides cleaner, more modern interface
      li If you need custom cancel text, you'll need to explicitly add it using the <code>closeButtonText</code> parameter

    h2 Searchbar
    p Searchbar component has been updated:
    ul
      li Removed default "Cancel" text
      li Now uses <strong>icon only</strong> for the cancel button
      li Aligns with iOS design patterns
      li If you need custom cancel text, you'll need to explicitly add it using the <code>disableButtonText</code> parameter

    h2 Timeline
    h3 Removed Horizontal Timeline
    p The Horizontal Timeline style has been removed:
    ul
      li Only vertical timeline is now supported
      li This aligns with modern design patterns and improves consistency
      li If you were using horizontal timeline, you'll need to refactor to use vertical timeline
      li Consider using alternative layouts like Grid or Cards for horizontal content presentation

    h2 React
    p Framework7 React has been updated to support React 19:
    ul
      li Updated to the latest React 19 API
      li Improved TypeScript types
      li Better compatibility with React 19 features
      li Make sure to update your React dependencies to version 19 or later
      li Check <a href="https://react.dev/blog" target="_blank">React 19 release notes</a> for React-specific changes

    h2 Vue
    p Framework7 Vue continues to support the latest Vue 3 API:
    ul
      li Improved TypeScript types
      li Better compatibility with Vue 3 composition API
      li Ensure you're using Vue 3 for full compatibility

    h2 Svelte
    p Framework7 Svelte has been updated to Svelte 5:

      li Improved reactivity system
      li Better TypeScript support
      li Make sure to update your Svelte dependencies to version 5 or later
